# Circular Paragraph with Shadow

This project demonstrates how to create a circular paragraph element with a shadow effect using HTML and CSS.

## Usage

1. Copy the following HTML code and paste it into your HTML file:

   ```html
   <p></p>
   ```

2. Copy the following CSS code and paste it into your CSS file:

   ```css
   * {
       background: #F48B26;
   }

   p {
       background: #fff;
       position: fixed;
       padding: 30px;
       border-radius: 50%;
       margin: -30px 60px 0 0;
       box-shadow: 0 0 0 21px #F48B26, 0 -65px 0 -16px #fff;
   }
   ```

3. Open your HTML file in a web browser to see the circular paragraph with a shadow effect.

## Explanation

The provided code consists of an HTML paragraph element `<p></p>` and accompanying CSS styles to achieve the following:

- The paragraph is styled to have a white background (`background: #fff;`).
- It is positioned fixed on the viewport (`position: fixed;`) and centered 60 pixels from the top and right edges of the viewport (`margin: -30px 60px 0 0;`).
- The paragraph is made circular using a border-radius of 50% (`border-radius: 50%;`).
- It has a box-shadow effect applied to create a 3D effect:
  - An orange shadow surrounds the paragraph, giving it an orange border (`box-shadow: 0 0 0 21px #F48B26;`).
  - A white shadow is positioned below the paragraph, creating a light source effect (`box-shadow: 0 -65px 0 -16px #fff;`).
